PROLOGUE:|
The year is 2100. You are <characterName>.
You were recently employed by RTech, the biggest space corporation in New America. 
Truthfully speaking, you were surprised you were hired given your complete lack of experience but grateful nonetheless. 
You are an “asset retrieval assistant” who has been assigned to your very first task. 
You were informed that a mining crew from the RTech extraction division was recently sent out to a remote planet as part of the new expansion project. 
Apparently there was an incident, so you, along with a partner have been tasked with securing and retrieving important company assets. 
As you walk into the transfer station, you observe the company issued shuttle pod that you would be taking. 
It looks like an old, rusty piece of junk that was made in the 2050’s. 
You’re not quite sure you trust it to take the two of you to your destination in one piece. 
Nonetheless, you embark on your journey along with your partner.
On the way to your destination, you decide to get to know your coworker better. You ask:^

a) “What’s your name?”|&
“Oh, I’m Cyttos, nice to meet you. What’s your name?” they reply.^

b) “Is this your first assignment too?”|
"Yep. I'm honestly pretty nervous," they answer.
This confuses you. Shouldn't they have assigned you with someone more experienced and able to teach you the ropes?^

You decide to ask another question.|
