The year is 2200. You were recently employed by RTech, the biggest space corporation in New America. Truthfully speaking, you were surprised you were hired given your complete lack of experience but grateful nonetheless. You are an “asset retrieval assistant” who has been assigned to your very first task. You were informed that a mining crew from the RTech extraction division was recently sent out to a remote planet as part of the new expansion project. Apparently there was an incident, so you, along with a partner have been tasked with securing and retrieving important company assets. 
As you walk into the transfer station, you observe the company issued shuttle pod that you would be taking. It looks like an old, rusty piece of junk that was made in the 2150’s. You’re not quite sure you trust it to take the two of you to your destination in one piece. Nonetheless, you embark on your journey along with your partner. On the way to your destination, you decide to get to know your coworker better. You introduce yourself and ask them for their name, to which they respond, “I’m Cyttos, nice to meet ya.” 
You decide to make some small talk with Cyttos:|

“Is this your first assignment too?”|
"Nah, this’s my second," Cyttos answers. You feel a bit relieved, knowing that Cyttos could probably teach you the ropes. “Ah, I barely did jack though, mostly just let my partner do the work.” You raise an eyebrow. “Relax, I’m just messin’ with ya... half messing…” Cyttos winks.^

“Do you know how to work the controls on this thing?”|
“Nah, this thing is locked in autopilot mode, so there’s no need. Only control we got over this piece of metal is an emergency brake.” “And that’s where?” you ask. “Uh… yeah, no clue. Think it should be in the manual somewhere around here? Dunno where that would be either though, I forgot.”^

Cyttos doesn’t seem very reliable, but at least they’re friendly. You wonder what else you could talk to Cyttos about:|

“This thing doesn’t seem safe, huh?”|
“I mean, it ain’t the worst ride I’ve been in before. Doesn’t make it any less of a sketchy piece of junk though. Corpo’s do love their budget cuts. Not like we can do much about it,” Cyttos shrugs.^

“Do you know what happened to the mining crew?”|
“Only as much as they told us. So nothin’. That’s RTech for ya.”^

“Do they usually give us this little to go off of?”|
“Pretty much. And they don’t like when we ask questions.”^

“It’s nothing dangerous right?”|
“Eh, you’re probably thinking too much about it. If it were actually dangerous, they’d make sure we were actually qualified to deal with it and all that.”^

Cyttos yawns. “Well, I’ma catch some Zs, it’s gonna be a hot minute till we get there. I’d recommend you do the same if you don’t wanna die of boredom.” Heeding their advice, you shut your eyes and drift off to sleep, wondering what the planet would be like.

An indeterminate amount of time later…

A violent jolt rips you from your sleep. Flashing red lights attack your tired eyes as loud, blaring alarms ring out through the ship. Something is very wrong and you wonder what the hell happened during your sleep. You look over to your right to see Cyttos frantically searching for the ship manual. You yell, “What the hell happened?”, to which Cyttos yells back, “I don’t know! I think something hit us!” Before the two of you can even fully process what to do, the ship crashes into something, knocking you out instantly…

Your eyes flicker open as you regain consciousness. Your ears are ringing and there’s a sharp pain in your head. You take note of your surroundings. Everything around you lies in complete disarray. Sparks occasionally fly out from electronics and parts of the walls and ceiling are caved in. The whole ship creaks and groans ominously. You look for Cyttos, but their seat is empty. You attempt to get up from your seat, which makes you notice how much your whole body aches. Using the armrest as support, you manage to lift yourself onto your feet. The faint glow of flickering red emergency lights act as your only source of light. You make your way over to the door of the cockpit and open it. You enter a narrow hallway. Above you, a dim light dangles loosely from its wire. There is a door to your left labeled “STORAGE” and a door to your right labeled “MEDICAL”. 
Which do you enter?:|
